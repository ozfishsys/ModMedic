A jar file is just a zip file
I can open it and see inside of it and check the json for it version name and loader

currently working on checking for duplicate mod file, and suggesting the new version

> list the mod file in the mods folder (add checking the properties file for location of the mods later)
> open the mod check the name against list if not there save | if mod opening don't work save to output could't verify mod (mod name)
> if name there save to output duplicate mods,
> continue until gone thought all mods
> print out OK or any mod error

after add check the server loader vs the loader the mods require
